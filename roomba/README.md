#### roomba_cpp, Simple C++ library for Roomba iCreate 2 

Roomba library C++

Files : Roomba.cpp, Roomba.h 

This library is complete and self contained and will run only on Mac, Linux, Raspberry-PI and Beaglebone (should run without any problem, but I have not tested it yet) 

````NOTE: This will not work in Windows```` 

To communicate with iCreate2 you need the FTDI cable like the one shown below 

![Cable](./images/iCreateCable.png)


If you dont have one you can easily hack one, please follow the instructions in these links to make one yourself, ````Note: The serial port in Roomba iCreate2 is a miniDin connector````

[link](http://www.irobot.com/filelibrary/pdfs/hrd/create/Create%20Open%20Interface_v2.pdf)



The main.cpp contains a sample of how to use the library, Right now the events supported are only bump events, I will be making changes to add more events and features

Compiling and running the main.cpp (sample program)

Make sure you change the **"/dev/tty.usbserial-DA017QCF"** to the device attached to your system when you connect your Roomba 


````

	** Compile **
	Roomba master % g++ -std=c++0x -c Roomba.cpp 
	Roomba master % g++ -std=c++0x -o ./test main.cpp Roomba.o -lpthread
	
	** Run **
	./test 
	
	Now you shoule hear first few notes of Vuelie from frozen movie and the robot will spin for 10 seconds
